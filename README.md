# Movie-Finder

## Description

We built this site to show upcoming films that will be playing in theaters as well as to show current movies playing in theaters. The user can input a zip code to locate theaters in their area to view locations, review showings and purchase tickets. The site will store the zip codes searched in local storage so that the user can return to the site and retrieve the search results easily after exiting the site. The technologies used to build this site were the Fandango and Rottentomatoes APIs, Tailwind CSS framework and javascript.
